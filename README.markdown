# About

This Java applet implements a visualization of [Fortune][]’s plane-sweep algorithm for creationg a [voronoi diagram][].

Here is a [live demo of the applet][applet].

The applet was created by Benny Kjær Nielsen and Allan Odgaard in spring of 2000 following a course in Computational Geometry taugbt by Pawel Winter at [DIKU][].

# Building and Running
ant compile

java -cp bin fortune.sweep.gui.swing.SwingFortune

# Notes

The purpose of the source is to visualize the algorithm, it is not a good base for an effecient implementation of the algorithm (it does not run in O(n log n) time).

The original source was initially lost and recovered using a Java decompiler so most variable names are nonsensical.
